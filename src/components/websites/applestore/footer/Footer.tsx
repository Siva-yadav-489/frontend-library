        leading card issuers. Eligible AirPods, HomePod and Beats products are

        pricing is rounded to the nearest rupee. Exact pricing will be provided
        by your card issuer, subject to your card issuer’s terms and conditions.
        Minimum order spend applies as per your card issuer’s threshold. No Cost
        EMI is not available to Business customers and cannot be combined with
        Apple Store for Education or Corporate Employee Purchase Plan pricing.
        Card eligibility is subject to terms and conditions between you and your
        card issuer. Offer may be revised or withdrawn at any time without any
        prior notice. Terms apply. <br />
        Representative example: <br />
        A purchase of ₹79900.00 repaid over 12 months with an interest rate of

        subsequent order adjustment(s) or cancellation(s) may result in instant
        cashback being recalculated, and any refund may be adjusted to account
